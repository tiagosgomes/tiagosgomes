### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience. My journey began after completing postgraduate studies in Software Engineering in October 2018, where I gained a strong foundation in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node and React. I excel in crafting engaging user interfaces and possess proficient skills in both front-end and back-end development. I leverage technologies like Java, Spring, Node.js, Express.js, SQL and NoSQL databases for back-end functionalities, along with REST/RESTful APIs for integrating robust backend systems. Additionally, I have a nuanced understanding of mobile development, having worked with Java and Kotlin for Android applications. I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality, responsive, and user-centric solutions for diverse clients and projects.
